## why to create the repository?

Cats is a greate library for functional programming in Scala. But, When I start to learn cats, I am confused with the mystery FP concepts, such as: SemiGroup, Monoid, Functor, Monad and so on, which seem to be some dark magic for me:

- what do the concepts mean?
- what's the relationship among them?
- when and where to use cats?
- how to use?

And maybe some guys are struggling in the same situition. So I create the repository to record the learning process, which may offer references for you.
